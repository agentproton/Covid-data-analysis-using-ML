Download the COVID -19 data of India for the month of May, 2020 and design a predictor for the number of deaths on a particular day. 
Hence, predict the number of deaths on  April 20, 2020 and June 10th , 2020. Verify your prediction with the actual number of deaths and 
hence calculate the accuracy of prediction
We are using with the help of numpy

collect data from my website or from the web for the month of May, 2020. Use 22 days data for training and rest 09 days data for testing.
Use both straight line fitting and quadratic curve fitting for predictor design and compare their performance in predicting accuracy
